abstract: Research in clinical and human neuroscience indicates that important brain mechanisms of self-consciousness are based on the integration of multisensory bodily signals (i.e., bodily self-consciousness, BSC), including signals coming from outside our body (i.e., exteroceptive signals, such as tactile, auditory, and visual information) and the inside of our body (i.e., interoceptive signals). In this chapter, we discuss selected behavioral and neuroimaging studies about how multisensory integration generates and modulates BSC in humans, with particular relevance to parietal mechanisms. We then review the neurology of disorders of BSC after acquired brain damage or dysfunction, ranging from body attentional disorders to delusional and illusory deficits about the patient's own body, associated with a breakdown of the link between the body and the self.
