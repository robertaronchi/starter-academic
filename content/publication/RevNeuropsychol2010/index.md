abstract: A review of 56 published reports of brain-damaged patients with unilateral hemispheric lesions, who showed delusional beliefs concerning the side of the body contralateral to the side of the lesion (contralesional) is presented. This neuropsychological disorder, termed “somatoparaphrenia” by Gerstmann in 1942, has been reported, with a few exceptions, in right-brain-damaged patients with left motor and somatosensory deficits, and the syndrome of left unilateral spatial neglect. Somatoparaphrenia is most often characterized by a delusion of disownership of left-sided body parts, with patients exhibiting a sense of non-belonging of the contralesional limbs, and frequently attributing the ownership of body parts to another person (typically, the doctor, the examiner, or a relative). This delusion may occur without associated anosognosia for motor deficits, and personal neglect. Somatosensory deficits and visual half-field disorders may be absent. Deficits of proprioception may play a relevant role, being present in most patients. Somatoparaphrenia is often brought about by extensive right-sided lesions. A number of patients with posterior (parietal-temporal), and insular damage are on record, as well as a few patients with subcortical lesions, while lesions confined to the frontal lobe are rare. Possible pathological mechanisms include a deranged representation of the body concerned with ownership, mainly right-hemisphere-based, and deficits of multisensory integration. Somatoparaphrenic delusions and extra-personal unilateral spatial neglect are closely associated. One main feature of somatoparaphrenia may be a blurred distinction between corporeal (namely, the patients’ body parts), and extracorporeal (namely, body parts of other persons, or other non-corporeal items) objects.
